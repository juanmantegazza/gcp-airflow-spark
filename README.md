## Intro
### What is Cloud Composer ?
Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service that empowers you to author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across clouds and on-premises data centers. Built on the popular Apache Airflow open source project and operated using the Python programming language, Cloud Composer is free from lock-in and easy to use.

By using Cloud Composer instead of a local instance of Apache Airflow, users can benefit from the best of Airflow with no installation or management overhead.
